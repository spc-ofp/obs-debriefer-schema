Observer Debriefing Schema
=================

Schema for Observer debriefing application.
Currently the only supported RDBMS is SQL Server.

At this point in time, the legality of releasing
observer names and vessel data has not been worked out.
Therefore, users will need to fill in the "ref.vessels"
and "ref.field_staff" from an existing system or 
contact SPC to get a private data dump.
